## What This Is

This is a **workflow automation system** that lets you:

1. **Absorb** - Grab content from YouTube, articles, PDFs, or your own ideas
2. **Extract** - Turn it into a structured, reusable workflow
3. **Present** - Create polished presentations in seconds
4. **Execute** - Run your workflows with simple commands

**No coding. No technical skills. Just you and Claude.**

---

## The "Holy Shit" Moment

Once you're set up (takes 10 minutes), try this:

```
/gamma "5 ways AI is changing small business operations"
```

One command. 30 seconds. You get a **live presentation URL** you can share with anyone.

**Demo API key included** - we have lots of credits. Go wild.

2. Look for the green **"Code"** button (near the top of the page)
3. Click it
4. Click **"Download ZIP"**
5. Find the downloaded file (usually in your **Downloads** folder)
6. **Double-click** the ZIP file to unzip it
7. You'll get a folder called `fourrooms-main` or similar

9. **Move it** to your Desktop (or wherever you want to keep it)

**Confirmation:** You should have a folder on your Desktop called `fourrooms` with files inside.

### Option B: Clone with GitHub Desktop (Better for Updates)

If you want to easily get updates later:

8. Click **"Clone"**

**Confirmation:** GitHub Desktop shows the repository and you can see the files.

---

## Step 4: Open the Project in Claude Desktop

This is where the magic happens. You're telling Claude to use the skills in this folder.

### How to Open a Project

1. Open **Claude Desktop** (the app you installed in Step 2)
2. Look at the **bottom left** of the window
3. You should see a folder icon or text that says **"No project"** or **"Choose Project"**
4. Click it
5. A file browser will open
6. Navigate to where you saved the `fourrooms` folder
7. **Select the folder itself** (not a file inside it)
8. Click **"Open"** or **"Select"**

### Alternative: Drag and Drop

1. Open **Claude Desktop**
2. Open **Finder** (Mac) or **File Explorer** (Windows)
3. Find your `fourrooms` folder
4. **Drag the folder** into the Claude Desktop window
5. Drop it when you see it highlight

**Confirmation:** At the bottom of Claude Desktop, you should see the folder name (like "fourrooms" or "FR-Workflows").

---

## Step 5: Try Your First Command

Now let's make sure everything works!

### In Claude Desktop, type:

```
/gamma "3 simple ways to be more productive"
```

Then press **Enter**.

### What Should Happen

1. Claude will say it's generating a presentation
2. You'll see it calling the Gamma API
3. After about 30 seconds, you'll get a **link**
4. Click the link - it opens a **full presentation** in your browser

**That's it. You just created a professional presentation with one command.**

---

## Step 6: Verify Everything Works

Try these commands to make sure all skills are working:

### Test 1: Create another presentation
```
/gamma "How to start a podcast this year"
```

### Test 2: See what skills are available
Just type:
```
What skills do I have access to?
```

Claude will list all the available commands.

### Test 3: Get help
```
/workflow help
```

This shows you how to use the workflow builder.

# Troubleshooting

## "I don't see any skills/commands"

**Problem:** When you type `/gamma` nothing happens.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you opened the folder as a **Project** (Step 4)
2. Check the bottom left of Claude Desktop - it should show "fourrooms"
3. If it says "No project", click it and select the folder again
4. Try closing and reopening Claude Desktop

---

## "Claude says it doesn't have access to the Gamma API"

**Problem:** Claude tries to run `/gamma` but says it can't access the API.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure the `.env` file exists in your fourrooms folder
2. The file should contain: `GAMMA_API_KEY=sk-gamma-6VFufds97bR7JWyLpM9PvRfwD0OmZpkQRZrDKCDY`
3. If the file is missing, create a new file called `.env` (just ".env", no other name)
4. Paste the API key line above into it
5. Save and try again

---

## "The ZIP file won't open / I can't find the folder"

**Problem:** Downloaded the ZIP but can't find or open it.

**Fix (Mac):**
1. Open **Finder**
2. Click **Downloads** in the sidebar
3. Find the file ending in `.zip`
4. Double-click it to unzip
5. A new folder will appear next to it

**Fix (Windows):**
1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Go to **Downloads**
3. Right-click the `.zip` file
4. Click **"Extract All"**
5. Choose where to extract (Desktop is easy)
6. Click **Extract**

---

## "Claude Desktop won't open / crashes"

**Problem:** The app won't start or keeps crashing.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you have a Claude Pro or Max subscription (free tier doesn't include Desktop)
2. Try restarting your computer
3. Uninstall and reinstall Claude Desktop
4. Make sure your operating system is up to date

---

## "I get an error when running a command"

**Problem:** Claude shows an error message.

**Fix:**
1. **Copy the entire error message**
2. Paste it back to Claude and ask: "What does this error mean and how do I fix it?"
3. Claude will explain and help you fix it

---

## "My presentations look different than expected"

**Problem:** The Gamma presentation doesn't match what you wanted.

**Fix:**
1. Be more specific in your prompt: `/gamma "5 actionable tips for [specific topic] aimed at [specific audience]"`
2. You can edit the presentation after it's created - click the link and use Gamma's editor
3. Ask Claude: "Can you make me a presentation about X with these specific sections: A, B, C"

---

## "I can't find the transcripts folder"

**Problem:** After running `/absorb`, you can't find where the file went.

**Fix:**
1. The file is saved in the `transcripts/` folder inside your fourrooms folder
2. In Claude, ask: "What files are in the transcripts folder?"
3. Or open Finder/File Explorer and navigate to: `fourrooms/transcripts/`

# FAQ

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. Claude handles all the technical stuff. You just type commands in plain English.

**Do I need to use the terminal/command line?**
No. Everything works through Claude Desktop's chat interface. It looks like texting.

**What if I break something?**
You can't really break anything. If something goes wrong, just ask Claude what happened. You can always re-download the folder and start fresh.

**Can I create my own skills?**
Yes! Skills are just markdown files. Ask Claude: "Help me create a skill that does X"

**What's the difference between a skill and a workflow?**
- **Skill** = A command that does something (like `/gamma` creates presentations)
- **Workflow** = A structured process you've extracted from content (like "how to run a sales call")

**Can I use this for my business?**
Absolutely. Create presentations, extract knowledge, build repeatable processes. This is designed for exactly that.

**How do I get updates?**
If you used GitHub Desktop (Option B in Step 3), just click "Fetch origin" to get updates. If you downloaded the ZIP, you'll need to download it again.
