# TikTok Content Strategy for Business

Create viral-worthy TikTok/Reels content that generates leads and sales for your business using Keenya Kelly's proven methodology.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, have these ready:
- **Business Niche**: Your category (branding, coaching, hair care, etc.)
- **Target Audience**: Who you're reaching (age, interests, pain points)
- **Product/Service**: What you're ultimately selling
- **Lead Magnet Link**: URL to your opt-in page (optional but recommended)

## Tools/Services

This workflow uses:
- **Video Recording** - Any smartphone with a camera
- **Video Editing** - CapCut (free, syncs with TikTok)
- **Content Platforms** - TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
- **Email Marketing** - ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or any email provider

## The Keenya Kelly Method

### Core Philosophy

> "People don't buy from videos directly. Videos generate leads, email converts them to sales."

Your TikTok/Reels strategy is the **top of the funnel**. You're not trying to make money from views - you're building a community and pulling people onto your email list where you nurture and sell.

### Why This Works

- 50+ year old women are crushing it on TikTok
- One client made $20K in 7 days, then $1M/year from vertical video
- Your audience IS there - they're watching, just not posting
- The algorithm rewards content people watch all the way through

## The Process

### Step 1: Research Before You Create

**Don't start creating yet.** First, go to TikTok:
1. Tap the search icon (magnifying glass, upper right)
2. Type 1-2 words describing what you do
3. Watch the top-performing content
4. Bookmark videos that resonate

You're looking for:
- What topics perform best?
- What hooks grab attention?
- What formats work (talking head, text overlay, skits)?
- How do successful creators in your niche present themselves?

### Step 2: Understand the Culture

TikTok is NOT LinkedIn or Facebook. It allows more creativity.

**You don't have to:**
- Dance
- Be goofy
- Act out of character

**You do need to:**
- Be relatable
- Be entertaining (in your own way)
- Adapt to what works on the platform

### Step 3: Find Your Relatable Scenarios

List everything your target audience deals with daily:

*Example for entrepreneurs:*
- Sending an email to 20,000 people with the wrong link
- Client ghosting after saying "let's do this"
- Imposter syndrome before a big call
- Tech failing right before going live

These scenarios become your content goldmine.

### Step 4: Master the Hook

**You have 1-1.5 seconds to stop the scroll.**

Your hook can be:
1. **Text on screen** - A compelling statement they must read
2. **First image** - Something visually arresting
3. **First words** - An opening line that demands attention

**Hook templates:**
- "Stop scrolling if you [pain point]..."
- "The biggest mistake [audience] makes is..."
- "I made $X doing this one thing..."
- "Nobody talks about this but..."
- [Controversial statement about your industry]

### Step 5: Record Your Video

**Critical rules:**
- NO "Hey guys!" or introductions
- Start DIRECTLY with your hook
- Keep it short (15-60 seconds is ideal)
- Record in segments for jump cuts
- Change locations/scenes if possible

**The millennial pause will kill you.** Don't sit there for a second before talking - edit it out.

### Step 6: Edit with CapCut

**Must-haves:**
- **Captions** - 80% watch on mute
- **Jump cuts** - Every 3-5 seconds keeps attention
- **Clean text** - Readable, on-brand fonts

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Trending sounds
- Scene transitions
- B-roll footage

### Step 7: The Call-to-Action

Your goal is LEADS, not views.

- Put your link in bio
- Use tracking links (separate for TikTok vs Instagram)
- Drive them to opt-in for something valuable
- Don't ask for the sale in the video

### Step 8: Cross-Post Everywhere

One video = multiple platforms:
- TikTok
- Instagram Reels
- YouTube Shorts
- Facebook Reels

Same content, 4x the reach.

### Step 9: Adapt Trends to Your Business

When you see a trending sound/format:

1. Ask: "How can I make this about MY business?"
2. Keep the trend format
3. Change the text/scenario to your niche

**Example:** Guy crying and falling on bed → "When you send an email to 20,000 people with the wrong link" (relatable to entrepreneurs)

### Step 10: Convert via Email

Once they're on your list:
- Nurture with value
- Build relationship
- Sell your products/services
- The video got them in, email closes them

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not learning the culture** - What works on LinkedIn won't work here
2. **Making videos longer than needed** - If it could be 30 seconds, don't make it 2 minutes
3. **Starting with introductions** - "Hey guys!" = instant scroll
4. **No captions** - You're losing 80% of potential viewers
5. **Focusing on followers over leads** - 10,000 followers who don't buy = worthless

## Success Metrics

Track these, not vanity metrics:

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Email list growth | Leads are the goal |
| Lead-to-customer rate | Are they buying? |
| Watch completion rate | Algorithm loves this |
| Saves and shares | High-intent engagement |
