### CONTENT (2-X seconds)
[Scene 1 - 3 seconds]
[Say]: "..."
[Action]: [Any movement/gesture]

[Scene 2 - 3 seconds]
[Say]: "..."

[Continue with jump cuts every 3-5 seconds]

### CTA (Final 2-3 seconds)

3. **Shorter is better** - Don't pad for length
4. **Jump cuts** - Every 3-5 seconds
5. **Captions always** - 80% watch on mute

7. **Relatable > Perfect** - Authenticity wins
8. **Adapt, don't copy** - Make trends your own
