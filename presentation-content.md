# FR-Workflows: Turn Knowledge Into Action

## The Problem

You learn something valuable - a framework, a process, a strategy - and then what?

- It sits in your notes
- You forget the steps
- You reinvent the wheel every time
- Knowledge stays trapped in your head

**Your business runs on processes. But capturing and reusing them is a nightmare.**

## The Solution: Workflow Automation for Non-Coders

**FR-Workflows** lets you:

1. **Absorb** - Grab content from anywhere (YouTube, articles, PDFs, your own voice)
2. **Extract** - Turn it into a structured, reusable workflow
3. **Present** - Create polished presentations in seconds
4. **Execute** - Run your workflows with simple commands

**Zero coding required.** Claude does the technical work.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Absorb

Watch a great YouTube tutorial? Grab it:
```
/absorb https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123
```

The transcript is saved locally, ready to process.

### Step 2: Extract

Turn that content into a workflow:
```
/extract-workflow transcripts/the-video.txt
```

Now you have:
- Structured steps
- Required inputs
- Tools needed
- Automation potential

### Step 3: Present

Need to share it? Make a presentation:
```
/gamma completed-workflows/the-video.prompt.md
```

Live URL in 30 seconds. Professional slides. AI-generated images.

## The "Holy Shit" Moment

Try this right now:
```

One command. One topic. Full presentation.

**That's the power of workflow automation.**

## Real Examples

People have used this to create:
